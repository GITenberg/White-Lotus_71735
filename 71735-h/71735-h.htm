    <div class="verse indent18">—Rig Veda.</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/image005.jpg" width="200" height="356" alt="" >
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> great God Indra had
once forgotten himself so far as to fall in love with a Princess of
Mortal Blood.</p>

<p>It must be said in extenuation that she was of the bluest blood, so
blue indeed that in comparison to it the sapphire would fade and grow
pale; and so aristocratic and ancient was her royal lineage that the
parchment on which the names of her ancestors were duly recorded would
easily have stretched across the peninsula from Mount Davalaghiri to
Cape Comorin, and with a little tugging might easily have reached over
to Ceylon as far as Adam’s Peak.</p>

<p>Now the Ruler of the gods knew well enough that the Princess was
unapproachable by men, no matter how exalted their rank. As a God he
was invisible to mankind; therefore, to the great shock and indignation
of the other gods and his wife Indrani, he took the incarnation of
a beautiful Angora cat, as fluffy and delicate as a cotton puff,
immaculately white, with a bushy tail, gray-green eyes, very bristling
mustachios and a nose pink as a rose coral bead.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <img src="images/image006a.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="342" >
   <img src="images/image006b.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="371" >
</div>

<p>Then he dropped into the lap of the Rajah, the father of the Princess,
as he was driving in state through the town.</p>

<p>“Surely this is a message from the gods, O Protector!” said humbly the
Prime Minister. “Many moons has the Princess of all virtues wished for
such a perfect specimen, and if the Protector will deign to utter the
wish it will be presented to the Princess.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <img src="images/image008a.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="255" >
   <img src="images/image008b.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="336" >
</div>

<p>“Be it so,” wearily said the Rajah.</p>

<p>Thus it happened that the Angora was incorporated into the royal
household. The Princess took a violent fancy to White Lotus, as she
named him; nothing was too exquisite or too rare for him, and he was
much more important an individual than the Prime Minister or even her
own mother.</p>

<p>Every morning three white-turbaned bearers would offer him a beautiful
crystal bowl teeming with the fattest and most picturesquely variegated
gold-fishes; then followed three other bearers, who, humbly salaaming,
would present him a gorgeous silver bowl with milk from the fairest of
Cashmere goats.</p>

<p>And while he was eating and drinking to his content, a numerous band of
court musicians would softly play on stringed instruments.</p>

<p>When he had finished his repast, and while he was busy licking his
paws, the court poet would appear and, salaaming profoundly, address
him with befitting titles and denominations, which had no limit but the
poet’s fervid imagination, and certain of which were:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“O Lord of the Milk!</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Perfumed Almond Flower!</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">O Little Rajah of the Moon!</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">Whisper from the Milky Way!</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">Thou Pearl from the Green Sea!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="figcenter">
   <img src="images/image010a.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="353" >
   <img src="images/image010b.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="351" >
</div>

<p>And the poet would further recite a neatly-turned sonnet in which
he extolled his charms and beauty with a bold and daring simile that
had to be invented every day anew. After all these ceremonies, court
etiquette permitted him to enter the pavilion of the Princess, there to
be petted and stroked by his fair admirer.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <img src="images/image012.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="472" >
</div>

<p>He would manifest his love to her the best way he could, by purring
softly and gently and by rubbing his silken body under her bejeweled
hand. When she grew tired of caressing and playing with him she would
order her servants to bring one of her large jewel-chests. Out of it
she would choose a bracelet for the slender neck of White Lotus. One
day it might be a bracelet inlaid with pearls, the next day perhaps one
of rubies, the following emeralds, and then endless combinations and
designs with the most astonishing variety of precious stones and gems,
in rotation, for three hundred and sixty-five days in the year; and
never did White Lotus wear the same ornament more than once.</p>

<p>Those were happy days for him, and he drank the cup of Delight, slowly,
sipping it with the intensity and fervor of One Who Knew.</p>

<p>Their anger was great when the other gods saw how Indra had stooped
so low as to fall in love with a common mortal and had furthermore
impersonated a low, fish-eating animal; but, to their intense disgust,
he seemed indifferent to their wounded feelings and his wife’s
jealousy; he appeared supremely happy and quite unconscious that time
was flying and that he was still desecrating his high office by such
behavior.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <img src="images/image014a.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="293" >
   <img src="images/image014b.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="425" >
</div>

<p>So they all met in council and agreed upon a plan which would force him
from his present condition and restore him to his state.</p>

<p>Next morning the Princess fell suddenly and dangerously ill. The most
famous healers, quacks and doctors were summoned from the remotest
corners of the peninsula, but all this was of small avail; she grew
from bad to worse, until they all felt that mute Death could not be far
away.</p>

<p>White Lotus in the meantime was in great anguish; helpless and lonely
he wandered round the palace like a lost Soul in search of Paradise.</p>

<p>With a lover’s intuition he had divined who was to blame for this
insidious vengeance which was intended to wound him mortally.</p>

<p>After fruitless deliberation, he quickly ascended the highest tower in
the palace, and from there demanded obedience from the mutinous gods;
but he was only derided; then he invoked their kindness and mercy.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <img src="images/image016.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="391" >
</div>

<p>After a long silence a clear voice rang out from the sky above him:
“Sacrifice for sacrifice, weep seven times as the sun goes up and as
the sun goes to rest, and those tears will save the Princess....”</p>

<p>He returned to the palace, and there, in great sadness and hope, wept
tears for the redemption of a precious life. The crystal bowl filled
with his tepid tears was brought to the dying Princess, and she was
sprinkled with them and ablution was performed.</p>

<p>This improved her condition, and the ablution was repeated in the
morning and in the evening for seven days and seven nights until the
Princess recovered and then called for her saviour.</p>

<p>But now poor White Lotus had wept his eyes out, and had to be carried
lean and misshapen into the arms of the Princess, and there, with a
last quiver, he nestled against her heart and died happy.</p>

<p>They burned him with royal honors, and great festivities followed.</p>

<p>When the Princess looked into the bowl she saw the eyes of White
Lotus staring at her from its depth; they were crystallized as if to
perpetuate his love and sacrifice.</p>

<p>She had them set in a bracelet of gold and pearls, that she might look
into his eyes as long as she lived.</p>

1.F.
</div>
<div>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>
<div>

of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div>
<div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>
<div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>
<div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>
<div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>
<div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>
<div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>
<div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div>
<div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>
<div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
<div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>
<div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
